# Key_Logger
This Python code snippet uses the pynput library to create a keylogger. The main feature of this code is its ability to record and log key presses. It captures the keys pressed by a user and appends them to a file named "keyfile.txt." This can be a valuable tool for learning about keyboard event handling in Python and understanding how keyloggers work.

However, it's essential to highlight that the use of keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Keyloggers are often associated with malicious activities such as identity theft and invading privacy. It is crucial to respect the privacy and consent of individuals in any programming endeavor.

Instead of using this code for unethical purposes, I strongly encourage learners to use it as a means to understand how keyloggers function from a defensive standpoint. In the field of cybersecurity, it's essential to be familiar with how such tools work in order to protect against them. Always use your programming skills responsibly and within legal boundaries, focusing on ethical applications and the security of computer systems and networks.
